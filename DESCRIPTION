Description: Some basic features of MUMPS (Multifrontal Massively Parallel
	sparse direct Solver) are wrapped in a class whose methods can be used
	for sequentially solving a sparse linear system (symmetric or not)
	with one or many right hand sides (dense or sparse).
	There is a possibility to do separately symbolic analysis,
	LU (or LDL^t) factorization and system solving.
