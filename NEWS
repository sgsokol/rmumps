Version 5.0.1.12
================

* 2017-03-06
 - added library SCOTCH v6.0.4 (http://gforge.inria.fr/projects/scotch/) as option for ordering (...$set_icntl(3, 7))
 - default ICNTL(33) is set to 1, i.e. the determinant is calculated (before was 0, i.e. no determinant calculation)

* 2016-04-12
 - added method triplet() rendreding a simple_triplet_matrix (cf. package slam)
 - fixed job registering for symbolic() method
 - fixed compiler warning about non initialized n and nz in new_mat();
 - fixed valgrind's warning about non initialized memory use in dmumps()

Version 5.0.1.8
===============

* 2016-02-22
 - added constructor from slam::simple_triplet_matrix
 - added multiple right hand side solver for slam::simple_triplet_matrix
 - added S3method for Rcpp_Rmumps class: solve(), dim(), nrow(), ncol(), print(), show();
 - fixed constructor from i, j, v triplicate;

Version 5.0.1.7
===============

* 2016-01-20
 - INTEGER type is compiled as int32 and not int64 as in previous version;
 - fixed a typo in inst/example.R;

  + no more cmake is needed on Linux and Mac OS;
  + no more sources kept in binary package;
  + MAKE env. variable is respected now;
  + explicit mention of gcc is removed;
  + /bin/rm is replaced by $(RM);
  + fixed a non initialized variable use in C++ code;
  + a .a prefix is used for static library on Windows instead of .dll;
 - fixed the use of default values in constructors which are ignored by
   RcppModule (detected by UBSAN test run by R-core team);

Version 5.0.1.4
===============
